  The world needs more free to use and open-source platforms helping people around the world fighting diseases like Covid. You could have helped so many people out there with your platform. But I'm so sorry you didn't!
I tried to convince you for a very long time, but you didn't listen. Now I'm going and hope that you'll change your mind one day. Good luck!
