    - a campaign you should keep an eye on!

  The world needs more free to use and open-source platforms helping people around the world fighting diseases like Covid. You could have helped so many people out there with your platform. (e.g. when the largest South Korean clinic showed great interest in the early days of Covid. TBase could've been a GAME CHANGER at this time, think about this!)
I tried to convince you for a very long time, but you didn't listen. Now I'm going and hope that you'll understand one day. Good luck!
